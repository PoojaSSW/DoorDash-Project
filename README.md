Hello DoorDash Team

Here is the project I've created with the specs provided for develop this App.

For this project I've used React as a framework and have built up using https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app tool.

* Following is the entry point of this project.*

  * `public/index.html` is the page template;
  * `src/index.js` is the  entry point to load the App.js component that spins up the login page.

There is folder called `src`, that stores all the component level changes necessary for this App. I've put all necessary components inside the `src` folder for the Webpack to run these files.

** To build project:
 ###  `cd my-app/`

** In this directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

** For the apis, runfrom this repo:
### `npm run api-server`
